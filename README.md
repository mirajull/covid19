# covid19
Project Covid 19


Idea:

With COVID-19 all around the world, there is much information/misinformation about COVID-19. Can we analyze people's reaction to such information? We can collect data from social media platforms and do some data analytics. The type of reaction can be classified as reactions to posts or comments or replies. For the last two we need to do text analytics. 
 
We should also do some sentiment analysis of the feeds. [topic modeling of content could also be interesting] 
 
Also the information or misinformation can be fixed/categorized prior to analysis. → what is the ground truth to label/classify misinformation.  We would need some form of fact checker. [there might be some online tools for that too … if not we need to manually annotate data from well known established platforms]
 
Steps:

Data collection

Twitter (search for other hashtags too)

***Finding tweets, retweets containing particular hashtags or words like: 
#covid19 
#CoronaVirusUpdates
.
.
.
***Tracking those tweet’s reactions, comments, replies etc. 

Facebook
Linkedin
etc.
